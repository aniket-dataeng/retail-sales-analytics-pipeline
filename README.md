# Overview
This project implements a data pipeline that automates the process of:​
- Data Ingestion: Collecting raw retail sales data.
- Data Transformation: Cleaning and structuring data for analysis.
- Data Loading: Storing processed data into Snowflake for efficient querying.
- Data Analysis: Performing analytical queries to derive business insights.​
The pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data, ensuring data quality and consistency throughout the process.​

# Architecture
The pipeline follows a modular architecture:​
- Data Sources: Raw sales data files (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Ingestion Layer: Python scripts to read and validate data.
- Transformation Layer: Data cleaning and transformation using Python.
- Data Warehouse: Snowflake to store and manage processed data.
- Analytics Layer: SQL queries for data analysis and visualization.​

# Features
- Automated Data Pipeline: Streamlines the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
- Scalability: Handles large datasets efficiently.
- Data Quality Checks: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
- Modular Design: Easy to maintain and extend.
- Integration with Snowflake: Leverages Snowflake's capabilities for data warehousing.​

# Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Data Warehouse: Snowflake
- Data Processing: Pandas, SQL
- Version Control: Git
- Others: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis​

# Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
 - Python 3.x installed
 - Snowflake account - Update the config/snowflake_config.json file with your Snowflake account details.
 - Git installed​

# Usage
**Data Ingestion:** Place your raw sales data files into the data/raw/ directory.
**Run ETL Scripts:** Execute the Python scripts in the scripts/ directory to process and load data into Snowflake.
